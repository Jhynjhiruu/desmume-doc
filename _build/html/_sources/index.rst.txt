   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to desmume-doc!
=======================================

desmume-doc aims to document the DeSmuME emulator's Lua interface, because it is poorly documented and this makes it a nightmare to work with.
The interface is powerful and allows quite a lot of useful scripting, but there doesn't appear to be a single listing of all of the features.

Please note: desmume-doc does not cover the Lua language itself, only DeSmuME's Lua interface, so this is not an introduction to Lua programming.
