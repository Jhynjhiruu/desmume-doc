"emu.frameadvance()"
--------------------

Steps emulation one frame. Can be used when overriding the main
emulation loop.


"emu.gamecode()"
----------------

Retrieves the full game code of the currently loaded ROM as a string.


"emu.smallgamecode()"
---------------------

Retrieves the game code excluding the region code of the currently
loaded ROM as a string.


"emu.speedmode(mode)"
---------------------

"mode" is a string with a value of any of {"normal", "nothrottle",
"turbo", "maximum"}.

Sets the emulation speed when using "emu.frameadvance".


"emu.wait()"
------------

Tells the emulator to wait while the script does calculations. Note
that hotkeys are not disabled, so e.g. a savestate could still be
loaded while the emulator is waiting.


"emu.pause()"
-------------

Pauses emulation.


"emu.unpause()"
---------------

Unpauses emulation.


"emu.emulateframe()"
--------------------

Steps one frame. Equivalent to:

   emu.setspeed("normal")
   emu.frameadvance()


"emu.emulateframefastnoskipping()"
----------------------------------

Fast-forwards emulation once but render every frame. Equivalent to:

   emu.setspeed("nothrottle")
   emu.frameadvance()


"emu.emulateframefast()"
------------------------

Fast-forwards emulation once. Equivalent to:

   emu.setspeed("turbo")
   emu.frameadvance()


"emu.emulateframeinvisible()"
-----------------------------

Extremely-fast-forwards emulation once. Equivalent to:

   emu.setspeed("maximum")
   emu.frameadvance()


"emu.redraw()"
--------------

Redraws the current frame.


"emu.getframecount()"
---------------------

Gets the current frame count as an integer.


"emu.getlagcount()"
-------------------

Gets the current total lag frames as an integer.


"emu.lagged()"
--------------

Returns true if the current frame is a lag frame.


"emu.emulating()"
-----------------

Returns true if the emulator is currently running.


"emu.atframeboundary()"
-----------------------

Returns true if the emulator is at a frame boundary.


"emu.registerbefore(func)"
--------------------------

"func" is a function taking no arguments.

Sets up a callback function to run before every frame starts. Can be
used to e.g. set up memory or controller inputs for the next frame.

Example:

   function myCallback()
       print("Frame starting")
   end

   emu.registerbefore(myCallback)


"emu.registerafter(func)"
-------------------------

"func" is a function taking no arguments.

Sets up a callback function to run after every frame ends. Can be used
to e.g. read out memory or controller dataa for the previous frame.

Example:

   function myCallback()
       print("Frame ending")
   end

   emu.registerafter(myCallback)


"emu.registerstart(func)"
-------------------------

"func" is a function taking no arguments.

Sets up a callback function to run on script start or reset. Does not
work correctly with script start.

Example:

   function myCallback()
       print(emu.gamecode())
       file = io.open("log.txt", "w+")
   end

   emu.registerstart(myCallback)


"emu.registerexit(func)"
------------------------

"func" is a function taking no arguments.

Sets up a callback function to run on script end.

Example:

   function myCallback()
       file:close()
   end

   emu.registerexit(myCallback)


"emu.persistglobalvariables(variabletable)"
-------------------------------------------

"variabletable" is a table comprising keys and values.

Defines a global variable for each key in "variabletable". The
variables will be set to the values they had the last time the script
exited, or the value provided in the table if that is not available.
To set a default value of "nil" for a variable, pass the variable name
as a string with no associated value.

Example:

   emu.persistglobalvariables({
       variable1 = defaultvalue1,
       variable2 = defaultvalue2,
       -- ...
   })


"emu.message(str)"
------------------

"str" is a string with the message to be displayed.

Displays an info message to the user.


"emu.print(...)"
----------------

Replacement for "luaB_print()" that outputs to the appropriate textbox
instead of stdout.


"emu.openscript(filename)"
--------------------------

"filename" is a string containing the filepath of the script to open.

Opens a new Lua script. Only available in the Windows frontend.


"emu.reset()"
-------------

Resets the currently loaded ROM.


"emu.addmenu(menuName, menuEntries)"
------------------------------------

"menuName" is a string containing the name the new menu should have.
"menuEntries" is a table containing the entries that the menu will
have.

TODO: add an example for this.


"emu.setmenuiteminfo(menuItem, infoTable)"
------------------------------------------

"menuItem" is a… actually, I really have no idea.

TODO: work out how the hell this function works


"emu.registermenustart(func)"
-----------------------------

"func" is a function taking ?? arguments.

TODO: literally all of the menu stuff


"emu.register3devent(func)"
---------------------------

"func" is a function taking ?? arguments.

TODO: figure out 3D stuff


"emu.set3dtransform(mode, matrix)"
----------------------------------

"mode" is a number with a value of either 2 or 3. "matrix" is a camera
matrix.
